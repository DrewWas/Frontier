## What is the final design of the structure (how many pieces, what do they look like, how do they connect to each other)


 * The structure will come in two variations 
    - 7x7x7ft and 7x7x9ft
        -> The extra 2ft on the extended version is meant to be able to be used either vertically, horizontally, or long-ways (Ex: you can use it to make your shed extra long or extra tall)
    - Therefore, the shed is either a perfect square or a little more rectangular   


* The structure is split into 3 primary parts 
    - Roof/Floor(Foundation)
    - Walls
    - Collumns

    -> 1 Floor piece
    -> 1 Roof piece
    -> 4 Collumns
    -> 4 walls (not all have to be used if customer wants an open structure)

 
* How do collumns connect to floor/roof?
    - idea 1: Male/Female socket type connection. The collumns have an extra long part that just barely fits into a square hole/opening in the floor and roof and they slip into each other but the male/female connection is tight enough that there doesnt need to be any reinforcements

    - idea 2: 



^&^&^& Watch youtube videos of how other sheds/small structures do this

* How do walls connect to collumns?
    -


* In total there are __ pieces, although they will all be one solid piece, they may be folded somehow in order to fit into a shipping box. This, however, is the main focus of the next file
