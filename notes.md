# Frontier is an organization with the goal of simplifying the process and design of structures


## The end goal of Frontier is to open - "The High Frontier" as described by Gerard O'Neill



* The pathway to the high frontier (Very high level)

    - Begin making proof of concept sheds and garages (human-assembled, tho very easily human assembled)

    - Use these POC structures to build garages/random structures for anyone who wants

    - Get VC funding (???)

    - Start building tiny homes (only single floor)

    - Scale to regular size homes





## Unique Design Choices


 * (To start at least) The structures are all made of small, modular cubes. These cubes are created via 4 vertical beams through the ground and prefabed walls that slide into these walls. This way, if someone would like to "expand" thier house, they would "simply" pop the roof off, slide out a wall, and then pop in two more wall supports/frames/collumns and then slide in two more walls. The whole premise is that the design is as simple as possible

* Design will be -incredibly- minimalist. Nothing fancy, as that would be somewhat of a hinderece to aesthetic, but more importantly would be a harder technical challenge  

* Should be no more than 20 total pieces (including ceiling, frame, floor, walls). Each piece should be able to be taken apart without having to take apart other parts of the shed (with the exception of frame and floor). EX, each wall should be able to come off without taking off any other walls or the roof; just as the roof should be able to come off without taking off any of the walls

* OK, fuck it. Most of the house is going to be 3D printed, but not in the traditional sense. We are going to SEPERATLEY 3D print the floor, each supporting wall collumn (the frame), the basic roofing structure, and possibly (likely) the walls and the roof... Not each part will be made of the same material. Still need to work on how to connect each part to each other



## Engineering


  * General Notes:
    - Frame and foundation work together to provide total support - walls and roof is more or less 'tacked' on




  * The structure is split into 4 parts
    - Foundation
    - Frame
    - Walls
    - Roof



 * Foundation
    
    - The foundation is obv a very important part of the house. 
    - *THE FOUNDATION IS DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF GROUND IT IS BUILT ON*

    - Option 1: Inverse Pier foundation 

      *  

        - 4 I-beams are placed directly in the ground with cement/weight at the bottom of them, deep in the ground. After this step, there is simply 4 I-beams sticking straight out of the ground with weights at the bottom (deep in the ground). Then, the floor is placed directly ontop of the ground, with outriggers that extend from the bottom of the floor and meet the ground below.  
        . Pros - Ground doesnt have to be leveled, relativley easy (dont have to pour concrete or some shit)

        . Cons - Area between ground and floor could lead to problems (although this is basically just a (very short) pier foundation)

        . Questions: 
                * How does the outrigger work (spring, telescoping pole, etc.)

                - 

                * Does it matter that each outrigger will likely be supporting the floor from a different height (prob not if its a spring system, but would a spring system be durable enough to last for decades??) 

                - No springs.       



    - Option 2: *This is what I wanna do* 
                Lets say fuck all this over-engineering and just do a plain flat foundation where the 4 frame collumns connect to the corners and therefore make it as simple as possible. Here, were telling the customer to level the ground themselves. In the future, auto-leveling tech would be cool but at this stage all it does is hinder development. In essence, we dont have a proper foundation (the best part is no part)


        * Problem: How do we transport/package the 3D printed elements (especially the big ass floor/foundation)?? Do we just ship a giant ass package with the x,y dimensions literally just being the same as the floor (package is size of floor, which could be relativley large) or break the floor into 4 pieces that must be assembled together. 
          
          - Breaking floor into 4 "corner" pieces
          Pros: Less brittle, more adjustable to flex and non 0degree surfaces

          Cons: More pieces to assemble, makes structure more succetable to water/insects


 * Frame



 * Walls



 * Roof
