## This is a list of things to do so that when I decide to actully ~work~ on this project, I'm not aimlessly doing bullshit. This list should make it clear and concise what needs to be done

# There will be a file for each of these steps

1. What is the final design of the structure (how many pieces, what do they look like, how do they connect to each other)

2. How will pieces be broken down so that they can be shipped. How large will package be. ~How do we ship it~  -> Dont overthink this one 
    - 1 & 2 are very similar problems

3. How will pieces be made (3D printed, mold, etc.)

4. Business model (Selling it as both a shed, backyard bar, backyard verticle farm, etc.)

5. Put together kits for each different way it can be used (vert farming kit)

6. Start website/social media campaign (anonomously) 

7. Prototype

8. Find problems with prototype and fix

9. Repeat steps 7 & 8 a few more times

10. Find customers (this step could also start after step 5)
