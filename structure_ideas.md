should floor/foundation and verticle frame be one piece or ship unattached??

    -Pros attached:
        * Probably more robust/structurally sound


    -Cons attached:
        * Hard as fuck to transport unless we do onsite printing (idk if i like idea of onsite printing... takes away from idea of self-assemblign also we would have to ship robots to peoples fucking houses)... OK well, alot of sheds ship pre-assembled. Well yea, but how tf are we gonna pre-assemble a shed in a dorm room. Because we will be working out of a dorm, frat house, or shitty apartment for the first few years, all major parts will have to come unassembled so that they can be shipped more easily. Also, this allows for greater quality control. If theres a chip or something goes wrong, we only have to throw away one frame colummn or floor, rather than 4 frame collumns and a floor


# Uses (DO NOT MARKET AS SHED, MARKET AS MULTI/INFINITE USE STRUCTURE)

    * One good use for these structures we built (when we are just starting off) is to market them as backyard, DIY verticle farms. Were already sellign the large shed-sized structure (that WILL be designed so that you can expand its footprint very easily EX: connect floors, pop out a wall, connect roofs), so we could also just sell a veritcle farming starter kit and instructions. Inside this starter kit will probably be like LED lights, shelfs, seeds, water piping, etc. 

    * Because we will be using collumns to allow for certain walls to be taken out, with the open frame it could be used as like a backyard bar or something, in this case tho, the frame will probably have to be larger than 7x7x7 (maybe even push that it could be used indoors??)
    - Just google "backyard bars" and it's like so perfect 



## What material/filament??

    * HDPE (High Density Polyethylene)
        - Pros: 
        * Good strength to weight ratio
        * FDA approved
        * Recycleable (good for environment/PR and also possibly cheap)
        * Water tight (this is a big one)

        - Cons:    
        * Shrinkage
        * Tends to warp while printing
        * Poor self adhesion


## First version is soley about selling a working product,
## Second version should actually have good features - such as...
    * Heated/Hydrophobic roof that melts snow therefore it doesnt need (as much) support 
    (wont be needed if roof is slopped, but I DONT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT TO SLOPE THE ROOF)
    * Ability to quickly add other walls/floors/roofs to the existing structure (main idea sorta)


# Dimensions
    * I want it to be a perfect square, so itll probably be roughly 7x7x7
    * Maybe sell an extended version that is larger in one dimension, but then the customer can decide how to configure that extra dimensional space (ex: they can choose to make it taller, wider, or longer)



# Floor/Foundation
    * Will be the thickest part of the structure because it bears all weight and must also protect against dew and insects in the ground



# Walls
    * The walls will be collumns in each 4 corners because this will make the structure more versatile. Although I do subscribe to the 'delete the part' philsophy, using collumns increases the structural integrity and also allows the customer to not use a wall or two if they wish for a more open vibe. In this case, then we could even market it as like a backyard bar or some shit 


# Roof
