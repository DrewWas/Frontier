# The first thing I can really think of would be creating some basic, super good CAD software that EVEVENTUALLY integrates with ML when designing and can validate saftey and regulatory protocals WHILE designing 

* I guess first step is just creating a CAD program that has seemless integration with our own printer
    - Then have the program detect if a design violates saftey/regulatory laws. This means it will likely need intuition in physics and engineering, or it could probably also be hard coded
    - Then, be able to take in images of homes and return a 3D cad model and instruction directions
    ^- Also, have the printer be able to optimize building software for things like minimizing material, maximixing saftey/strength, maximizing natural light, etc.
